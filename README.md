# XLang - A Simple Interpreted Language for Beginners

## Project Overview

**Purpose:** XLang is designed as an educational tool to introduce beginners to coding concepts. It emphasizes simplicity, clear error explanations, and key language features to facilitate a smooth entry into programming.

**Target Audience:** Beginners to coding.

**Simplicity:** XLang reduces complexities with easy-to-read syntax, avoiding unnecessary terms, and providing clear error explanations to ease new programmers into coding.

## Language Design (Syntax & Constructs)

- **Assignment:** `IS`
- **Data Types:** `NUMBER` (INT), `DECIMAL`, `WORDS`, `LETTER`, `T/F`, `LIST`, `DICT`, `GROUP`
- **Operations:** `PRINT`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `DIV`, `MULT`, `EQUAL`, `NOT EQUAL`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `GREATER THAN`, `GREATER OR EQUAL TO`, `LESSER THAN`, `LESSER OR EQUAL TO`
- **Control Flow:** `IF`, `THEN`, `LOOPS FOR`, `LOOP WHILE`
- **I/O:** `INPUT`, `OUTPUT`
- **Functions:** `DEFINE` (def _____)

## Lexer/Tokenizer

Refer to `lexer.c` for the implementation of the lexer.

## Parser

Refer to `parser.c` for the implementation of the parser.

## Interpreter

Refer to `interpreter.c` for the implementation of the interpreter.

## Error Handling

XLang provides informative error messages to assist users in understanding and debugging their code.

## How to Run Programs

1. Compile the source code using a C compiler.
2. Execute the compiled program, providing the XLang code file as an argument.

**Example:**
```bash
./xlang_interpreter program.xlang
```

## Our Design Choices

- **Simplicity:** Prioritizing simplicity in syntax and design to enhance the learning experience.
- **Clear Error Messages:** Designed to be informative, aiding users in identifying and rectifying issues in their code.

## Testing Examples

See screenshots and code examples in the repository demonstrating the interpreter's functionality in various scenarios.
